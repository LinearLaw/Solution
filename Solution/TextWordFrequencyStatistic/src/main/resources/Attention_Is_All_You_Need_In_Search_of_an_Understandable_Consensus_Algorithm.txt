Attention Is All You Need

Abstract The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 Englishto- German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.

1 Introduction

Recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [13] and gated recurrent [7] neural networks in particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and transduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [35, 2, 5]. Numerous efforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder architectures [38, 24, 15].

Equal contribution. Listing order is random. Jakob proposed replacing RNNs with self-attention and started the effort to evaluate this idea. Ashish, with Illia, designed and implemented the first Transformer models and has been crucially involved in every aspect of this work. Noam proposed scaled dot-product attention, multi-head attention and the parameter-free position representation and became the other person involved in nearly every detail. Niki designed, implemented, tuned and evaluated countless model variants in our original codebase and tensor2tensor. Llion also experimented with novel model variants, was responsible for our initial codebase, and efficient inference and visualizations. Lukasz and Aidan spent countless long days designing various parts of and implementing tensor2tensor, replacing our earlier codebase, greatly improving results and massively accelerating our research.

Recurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden states ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht1 and the input for position t. This inherently sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional computation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental constraint of sequential computation, however, remains.

Attention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduction models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in the input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms are used in conjunction with a recurrent network.

In this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output. The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.

2 Background

The goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU [16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models, the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]. In the Transformer this is reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as described in section 3.2.

Self-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].

End-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequencealigned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and language modeling tasks [34].

To the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying entirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequencealigned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate self-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].

3 Model Architecture

Most competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35]. Here, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1; :::; xn) to a sequence of continuous representations z = (z1; :::; zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output sequence (y1; :::; ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive [10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.

The Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully connected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1, respectively.

3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks

Encoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. Each layer has two sub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, positionwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is LayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer itself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding layers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.

Decoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head attention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention sub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This masking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the predictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.

3.2 Attention

An attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output, where the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum of the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the query with the corresponding key.

Figure 2: (left) Scaled Dot-Product Attention. (right) Multi-Head Attention consists of several attention layers running in parallel.

3.2.1 Scaled Dot-Product Attention

We call our particular attention "Scaled Dot-Product Attention" (Figure 2). The input consists of queries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the query with all keys, divide each by p dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the values.

In practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together into a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute the matrix of outputs as:

The two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multiplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor . Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with a single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is much faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized matrix multiplication code.

While for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms dot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of dk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has extremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by p1 dk .

3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention

Instead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries, we found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned linear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of queries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional output values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the final values, as depicted in Figure 2.

Multi-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions. With a single attention head, averaging inhibits this.

In this work we employ h = 8 parallel attention layers, or heads. For each of these we use dk = dv = dmodel=h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost is similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.

3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model

The Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:

In "encoder-decoder attention" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer, and the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the typical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as [38, 2, 9].


The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values and queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the encoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the encoder.


Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to all positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward information flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this inside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to 􀀀1) all values in the input of the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.

3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks

In addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully connected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.

While the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters from layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1. The dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality dff = 2048.

3.4 Embeddings and Softmax

Similarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input tokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transformation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In our model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax linear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by p dmodel.

3.5 Positional Encoding

Since our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the order of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the

tokens in the sequence. To this end, we add "positional encodings" to the input embeddings at the bottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel as the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings, learned and fixed [9].

In this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies: where pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding corresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2

to 10000

2 . We chose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by relative positions, since for any fixed offset k, PEpos+k can be represented as a linear function of PEpos.

We also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two versions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version because it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered during training.

4 Why Self-Attention

In this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolutional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations (x1; :::; xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1; :::; zn), with xi; zi 2 Rd, such as a hidden layer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we consider three desiderata.

One is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can be parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.

The third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range dependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the ability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to traverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input and output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare the maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the different layer types.

As noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially executed operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence length n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with sentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece [38] and byte-pair [31] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving very long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in the input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum path length to O(n=r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.

A single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output positions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n=k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels, or O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [18], increasing the length of the longest paths between any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than recurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [6], however, decrease the complexity considerably, to O(k

n

d + n

d2). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable convolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer, the approach we take in our model.

As side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions from our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention heads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic and semantic structure of the sentences.

5 Training

This section describes the training regime for our models.

5.1 Training Data and Batching

We trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million sentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [3], which has a shared sourcetarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT 2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece vocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training batch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000 target tokens.

5.2 Hardware and Schedule

We trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using the hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We trained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the bottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps (3.5 days).

5.3 Optimizer

We used the Adam optimizer [20] with

1 = 0:9,

2 = 0:98 and

= 10􀀀9. We varied the learning rate over the course of training, according to the formula:

This corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup_steps training steps, and decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used warmup_steps = 4000.

5.4 Regularization

We employ three types of regularization during training:

Residual Dropout

We apply dropout [33] to the output of each sub-layer, before it is added to the sub-layer input and normalized. In addition, we apply dropout to the sums of the embeddings and the positional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks. For the base model, we use a rate of Pdrop = 0:1.

Table 2: The Transformer achieves better BLEU scores than previous state-of-the-art models on the English-to-German and English-to-French newstest2014 tests at a fraction of the training cost.

Label Smoothing

During training, we employed label smoothing of value ls = 0:1 [36]. This hurts perplexity, as the model learns to be more unsure, but improves accuracy and BLEU score.

6 Results

6.1 Machine Translation

On the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, the big transformer model (Transformer (big) in Table 2) outperforms the best previously reported models (including ensembles) by more than 2:0 BLEU, establishing a new state-of-the-art BLEU score of 28:4. The configuration of this model is listed in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took 3:5 days on 8 P100 GPUs. Even our base model surpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of the competitive models.

On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41:0, outperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1=4 the training cost of the previous state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used dropout rate Pdrop = 0:1, instead of 0:3.

For the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which were written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We used beam search with a beam size of 4 and length penalty  = 0:6 [38]. These hyperparameters were chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during inference to input length + 50, but terminate early when possible [38].

Table 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model architectures from the literature. We estimate the number of floating point operations used to train a model by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs used, and an estimate of the sustained single-precision floating-point capacity of each GPU 5.

6.2 Model Variations

To evaluate the importance of different components of the Transformer, we varied our base model in different ways, measuring the change in performance on English-to-German translation on the development set, newstest2013. We used beam search as described in the previous section, but no checkpoint averaging. We present these results in Table 3.

In Table 3 rows (A), we vary the number of attention heads and the attention key and value dimensions, keeping the amount of computation constant, as described in Section 3.2.2. While single-head attention is 0.9 BLEU worse than the best setting, quality also drops off with too many heads.

Table 3: Variations on the Transformer architecture. Unlisted values are identical to those of the base model. All metrics are on the English-to-German translation development set, newstest2013. Listed perplexities are per-wordpiece, according to our byte-pair encoding, and should not be compared to per-word perplexities.

Table 4: The Transformer generalizes well to English constituency parsing (Results are on Section 23 of WSJ)

In Table 3 rows (B), we observe that reducing the attention key size dk hurts model quality. This suggests that determining compatibility is not easy and that a more sophisticated compatibility function than dot product may be beneficial. We further observe in rows (C) and (D) that, as expected, bigger models are better, and dropout is very helpful in avoiding over-fitting. In row (E) we replace our sinusoidal positional encoding with learned positional embeddings [9], and observe nearly identical results to the base model.

6.3 English Constituency Parsing

To evaluate if the Transformer can generalize to other tasks we performed experiments on English constituency parsing. This task presents specific challenges: the output is subject to strong structural constraints and is significantly longer than the input. Furthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequence models have not been able to attain state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes [37].

We trained a 4-layer transformer with dmodel = 1024 on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the Penn Treebank [25], about 40K training sentences. We also trained it in a semi-supervised setting, using the larger high-confidence and BerkleyParser corpora from with approximately 17M sentences [37]. We used a vocabulary of 16K tokens for the WSJ only setting and a vocabulary of 32K tokens for the semi-supervised setting.

We performed only a small number of experiments to select the dropout, both attention and residual (section 5.4), learning rates and beam size on the Section 22 development set, all other parameters remained unchanged from the English-to-German base translation model. During inference, we increased the maximum output length to input length + 300. We used a beam size of 21 and  = 0:3 for both WSJ only and the semi-supervised setting.

Our results in Table 4 show that despite the lack of task-specific tuning our model performs surprisingly well, yielding better results than all previously reported models with the exception of the Recurrent Neural Network Grammar [8].

In contrast to RNN sequence-to-sequence models [37], the Transformer outperforms the Berkeley- Parser [29] even when training only on the WSJ training set of 40K sentences.

7 Conclusion

In this work, we presented the Transformer, the first sequence transduction model based entirely on attention, replacing the recurrent layers most commonly used in encoder-decoder architectures with multi-headed self-attention.

For translation tasks, the Transformer can be trained significantly faster than architectures based on recurrent or convolutional layers. On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014 English-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best model outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.

We are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We plan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and to investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs such as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.

In Search of an Understandable Consensus Algorithm
 (Extended Version)

 Stanford University
 Abstract
 Raft is a consensus algorithmfor managinga replicated
 log. It produces a result equivalent to (multi-)Paxos, and
 it is as efficient as Paxos, but its structure is different
 from Paxos; this makes Raft more understandable than
 Paxos and also provides a better foundation for build
ing practical systems. In order to enhance understandabil
ity, Raft separates the key elements of consensus, such as
 leader election, log replication, and safety, and it enforces
 a stronger degree of coherency to reduce the number of
 states that must be considered. Results from a user study
 demonstrate that Raft is easier for students to learn than
 Paxos. Raft also includes a new mechanism for changing
 the cluster membership, which uses overlapping majori
ties to guarantee safety.
 1 Introduction
 Consensus algorithms allow a collection of machines
 to work as a coherent group that can survive the fail
ures of some of its members. Because of this, they play a
 key role in building reliable large-scale software systems.
 Paxos [15, 16] has dominated the discussion of consen
sus algorithmsoverthe last decade:most implementations
 of consensus are based on Paxos or influenced by it, and
 Paxos has become the primary vehicle used to teach stu
dents about consensus.
 Unfortunately, Paxos is quite difficult to understand, in
 spite of numerousattempts to make it more approachable.
 Furthermore, its architecture requires complex changes
 to support practical systems. As a result, both system
 builders and students struggle with Paxos.
 After struggling with Paxos ourselves, we set out to
 f
 ind a new consensus algorithm that could provide a bet
ter foundation for system building and education. Our ap
proach was unusual in that our primary goal was under
standability: could we define a consensus algorithm for
 practical systems and describe it in a way that is signifi
cantly easier to learn than Paxos? Furthermore,we wanted
 the algorithm to facilitate the development of intuitions
 that are essential for system builders. It was important not
 just for the algorithm to work, but for it to be obviouswhy
 it works.
 The result of this work is a consensus algorithm called
 Raft. In designing Raft we applied specific techniques to
 improveunderstandability,including decomposition(Raft
 separates leader election, log replication, and safety) and

 state space reduction (relative to Paxos, Raft reduces the
 degree of nondeterminismand the ways servers can be in
consistent with each other). A user study with 43 students
 at two universities shows that Raft is significantly easier
 to understand than Paxos: after learning both algorithms,
 33 of these students were able to answer questions about
 Raft better than questions about Paxos.
 Raft is similar in many ways to existing consensus al
gorithms (most notably, Oki and Liskov’s Viewstamped
 Replication [29, 22]), but it has several novel features:
 • Strong leader: Raft uses a stronger form of leader
ship than other consensus algorithms. For example,
 log entries only flow from the leader to other servers.
 This simplifies the management of the replicated log
 and makes Raft easier to understand.
 • Leader election: Raft uses randomized timers to
 elect leaders. This adds only a small amount of
 mechanismto theheartbeats already required for any
 consensus algorithm, while resolving conflicts sim
ply and rapidly.
 • Membership changes: Raft’s mechanism for
 changing the set of servers in the cluster uses a new
 joint consensus approach where the majorities of
 two different configurations overlap during transi
tions. This allows the cluster to continue operating
 normally during configuration changes.
 Webelieve that Raft is superior to Paxos and other con
sensus algorithms, both for educational purposes and as a
 foundation for implementation. It is simpler and more un
derstandable than other algorithms; it is described com
pletely enough to meet the needs of a practical system;
 it has several open-source implementations and is used
 by several companies; its safety properties have been for
mally specified and proven; and its efficiency is compara
ble to other algorithms.
 The remainder of the paper introduces the replicated
 state machine problem(Section 2), discusses the strengths
 and weaknesses of Paxos (Section 3), describes our gen
eral approach to understandability (Section 4), presents
 the Raft consensus algorithm (Sections 5–8), evaluates
 Raft (Section 9), and discusses related work (Section 10).
 2 Replicated state machines
 Consensus algorithms typically arise in the context of
 replicated state machines [37]. In this approach, state ma
chines on a collection of servers compute identical copies
 of the same state and can continue operating even if some
 of the servers are down. Replicated state machines are
 1
tency of the logs: faulty clocks and extreme message
 delays can, at worst, cause availability problems.
 • In the common case, a command can complete as
 soon as a majority of the cluster has responded to a
 single round of remote procedurecalls; a minority of
 slow servers need not impact overall system perfor
mance.
 3 What’s wrong with Paxos?

sensus algorithm manages a replicated log containing state
 machine commands from clients. The state machines process
 identical sequences of commands from the logs, so they pro
duce the same outputs.
 used to solve a variety of fault tolerance problems in dis
tributed systems. For example, large-scale systems that
 have a single cluster leader, such as GFS [8], HDFS [38],
 and RAMCloud [33], typically use a separate replicated
 state machine to manage leader election and store config
uration information that must survive leader crashes. Ex
amples of replicated state machines include Chubby [2]
 and ZooKeeper [11].
 Replicated state machines are typically implemented
 using a replicated log, as shown in Figure 1. Each server
 stores a log containing a series of commands, which its
 state machine executes in order. Each log contains the
 same commands in the same order, so each state ma
chine processes the same sequence of commands. Since
 the state machines are deterministic, each computes the
 same state and the same sequence of outputs.
 Keeping the replicated log consistent is the job of the
 consensus algorithm. The consensus module on a server
 receives commands from clients and adds them to its log.
 It communicates with the consensus modules on other
 servers to ensure that every log eventually contains the
 same requests in the same order, even if some servers fail.
 Once commands are properly replicated, each server’s
 state machine processes them in log order, and the out
puts are returned to clients. As a result, the servers appear
 to form a single, highly reliable state machine.
 Consensus algorithms for practical systems typically
 have the following properties:
 • They ensure safety (never returning an incorrect re
sult) under all non-Byzantine conditions, including
 network delays, partitions, and packet loss, duplica
tion, and reordering.
 • They are fully functional (available) as long as any
 majority of the servers are operational and can com
municate with each other and with clients. Thus, a
 typical cluster of five servers can tolerate the failure
 of any two servers. Servers are assumed to fail by
 stopping; they may later recover from state on stable
 storage and rejoin the cluster.
 • They do not depend on timing to ensure the consis
Over the last ten years, Leslie Lamport’s Paxos proto
col [15] has become almost synonymouswith consensus:
 it is the protocol most commonly taught in courses, and
 most implementations of consensus use it as a starting
 point. Paxos first defines a protocol capable of reaching
 agreement on a single decision, such as a single replicated
 log entry. We refer to this subset as single-decree Paxos.
 Paxosthen combinesmultiple instances of this protocolto
 facilitate a series of decisions such as a log (multi-Paxos).
 Paxos ensures both safety and liveness, and it supports
 changes in cluster membership. Its correctness has been
 proven, and it is efficient in the normal case.
 Unfortunately, Paxos has two significant drawbacks.
 The first drawback is that Paxos is exceptionally diffi
cult to understand. The full explanation [15] is notori
ously opaque;few peoplesucceed in understandingit, and
 only with great effort. As a result, there have been several
 attempts to explain Paxos in simpler terms [16, 20, 21].
 These explanations focus on the single-decree subset, yet
 they are still challenging. In an informal survey of atten
dees at NSDI 2012, we found few people who were com
fortable with Paxos, even among seasoned researchers.
 We struggled with Paxos ourselves; we were not able to
 understand the complete protocol until after reading sev
eral simplified explanations and designing our own alter
native protocol, a process that took almost a year.
 We hypothesize that Paxos’ opaqueness derives from
 its choice of the single-decree subset as its foundation.
 Single-decree Paxos is dense and subtle: it is divided into
 two stages that do not have simple intuitive explanations
 and cannot be understood independently. Because of this,
 it is difficult to develop intuitions about why the single
decree protocol works. The composition rules for multi
Paxos add significant additional complexity and subtlety.
 Webelievethat the overallproblemof reachingconsensus
 on multiple decisions (i.e., a log instead of a single entry)
 can be decomposedin other ways that are more direct and
 obvious.
 The second problem with Paxos is that it does not pro
vide a good foundation for building practical implemen
tations. One reason is that there is no widely agreed
upon algorithm for multi-Paxos. Lamport’s descriptions
 are mostly about single-decree Paxos; he sketched possi
ble approaches to multi-Paxos, but many details are miss
ing. There have been several attempts to flesh out and op
timize Paxos, such as [26], [39], and [13], but these differ
 2
from each other and from Lamport’s sketches. Systems
 such as Chubby [4] have implemented Paxos-like algo
rithms, but in most cases their details have not been pub
lished.
 Furthermore, the Paxos architecture is a poor one for
 building practical systems; this is another consequence of
 the single-decree decomposition.For example, there is lit
tle benefit to choosing a collection of log entries indepen
dently and then melding them into a sequential log; this
 just adds complexity. It is simpler and more efficient to
 design a system around a log, where new entries are ap
pended sequentially in a constrained order. Another prob
lem is that Paxos uses a symmetric peer-to-peer approach
 at its core (though it eventually suggests a weak form of
 leadership as a performance optimization). This makes
 sense in a simplified world where only one decision will
 be made, but few practical systems use this approach. If a
 series of decisions must be made, it is simpler and faster
 to first elect a leader, then have the leader coordinate the
 decisions.
 As a result, practical systems bear little resemblance
 to Paxos. Each implementation begins with Paxos, dis
covers the difficulties in implementing it, and then de
velops a significantly different architecture. This is time
consuming and error-prone, and the difficulties of under
standing Paxos exacerbate the problem. Paxos’ formula
tion may beagoodoneforprovingtheoremsaboutits cor
rectness, but real implementations are so different from
 Paxosthat theproofshavelittle value.The followingcom
ment from the Chubby implementers is typical:
 There are significant gaps between the description of
 the Paxos algorithm and the needs of a real-world
 system.... the final system will be based on an un
proven protocol [4].
 Because of these problems, we concluded that Paxos
 does not provide a good foundation either for system
 building or for education. Given the importance of con
sensus in large-scale software systems, we decided to see
 if we could design an alternative consensus algorithm
 with better properties than Paxos. Raft is the result of that
 experiment.
 4 Designing for understandability
 Wehadseveral goals in designing Raft: it must provide
 a complete and practical foundation for system building,
 so that it significantly reduces the amount of design work
 requiredof developers;it must be safe underall conditions
 and available under typical operating conditions; and it
 must be efficient for common operations. But our most
 important goal—and most difficult challenge—was un
derstandability. It must be possible for a large audience to
 understand the algorithm comfortably. In addition, it must
 be possible to develop intuitions about the algorithm, so
 that system builders can make the extensions that are in
evitable in real-world implementations.
 There were numerous points in the design of Raft
 where we had to choose among alternative approaches.
 In these situations we evaluated the alternatives based on
 understandability: how hard is it to explain each alterna
tive (for example,how complexis its state space, and does
 it have subtle implications?), and how easy will it be for a
 reader to completely understand the approach and its im
plications?
 We recognize that there is a high degree of subjectiv
ity in such analysis; nonetheless, we used two techniques
 that are generally applicable. The first technique is the
 well-known approach of problem decomposition: wher
ever possible, we divided problems into separate pieces
 that could be solved, explained, and understood relatively
 independently. For example, in Raft we separated leader
 election, log replication, safety, and membership changes.
 Our second approach was to simplify the state space
 by reducing the number of states to consider, making the
 system more coherent and eliminating nondeterminism
 where possible. Specifically, logs are not allowed to have
 holes, and Raft limits the ways in which logs can become
 inconsistent with each other. Although in most cases we
 tried to eliminate nondeterminism, there are some situ
ations where nondeterminism actually improves under
standability. In particular, randomized approaches intro
duce nondeterminism, but they tend to reduce the state
 space by handling all possible choices in a similar fashion
 (“choose any; it doesn’t matter”). We used randomization
 to simplify the Raft leader election algorithm.
 5 TheRaftconsensus algorithm
 Raft is an algorithm for managing a replicated log of
 the form described in Section 2. Figure 2 summarizes the
 algorithm in condensed form for reference, and Figure 3
 lists key properties of the algorithm; the elements of these
 f
 igures are discussed piecewise over the rest of this sec
tion.
 Raft implements consensus by first electing a distin
guished leader, then giving the leader complete responsi
bility for managing the replicated log. The leader accepts
 log entries from clients, replicates them on other servers,
 and tells servers when it is safe to apply log entries to
 their state machines. Having a leader simplifies the man
agement of the replicated log. For example, the leader can
 decide where to place new entries in the log without con
sulting other servers, and data flows in a simple fashion
 from the leader to other servers. A leader can fail or be
come disconnected from the other servers, in which case
 a new leader is elected.
 Given the leader approach, Raft decomposes the con
sensus problem into three relatively independentsubprob
lems, which are discussed in the subsections that follow:
 • Leader election: a new leader must be chosen when
 an existing leader fails (Section 5.2).
 • Log replication: the leader must accept log entries

 Machine Safety Property in Figure 3: if any server

 then no other server may apply a different command

 Raft ensures this property; the solution involves an
 additional restriction on the election mechanism de
scribed in Section 5.2.
 After presenting the consensus algorithm, this section dis
cusses the issue of availability and the role of timing in the
 system.
 5.1 Raftbasics
 ARaft cluster contains several servers; five is a typical
 number, which allows the system to tolerate two failures.
 At any given time each server is in one of three states:
 leader, follower, or candidate. In normal operation there
 is exactly one leader and all of the other servers are fol
lowers. Followers are passive: they issue no requests on
 their own but simply respond to requests from leaders
 and candidates. The leader handles all client requests (if
 a client contacts a follower, the follower redirects it to the
 leader). The third state, candidate, is used to elect a new
 leader as described in Section 5.2. Figure 4 shows the
 states and their transitions; the transitions are discussed
 below.
 Raft divides time into terms of arbitrary length, as
 shown in Figure 5. Terms are numbered with consecutive
 integers. Each term begins with an election, in which one
 or more candidates attempt to become leader as described
 in Section 5.2. If a candidate wins the election, then it
 serves as leader for the rest of the term. In some situations
 an election will result in a split vote. In this case the term
 will end with no leader; a new term (with a new election)
 Figure 4: Server states. Followers only respond to requests
 from other servers. If a follower receives no communication,
 it becomes a candidate and initiates an election. A candidate
 that receives votes from a majority of the full cluster becomes
 the new leader. Leaders typically operate until they fail.
 Figure 5: Time is divided into terms, and each term begins
 with an election. After a successful election, a single leader
 manages the cluster until the end of the term. Some elections
 fail, in which case the term ends without choosing a leader.
 The transitions between terms may be observed at different
 times on different servers.
 will begin shortly. Raft ensures that there is at most one
 leader in a given term.
 Different servers may observe the transitions between
 terms at different times, and in some situations a server
 may not observe an election or even entire terms. Terms
 act as a logical clock [14] in Raft, and they allow servers
 to detect obsolete information such as stale leaders. Each
 server stores a current term number, which increases
 monotonically over time. Current terms are exchanged
 whenever servers communicate; if one server’s current
 term is smaller than the other’s, then it updates its current
 term to the larger value. If a candidate or leader discovers
 that its term is out of date, it immediately reverts to fol
lower state. If a server receives a request with a stale term
 number, it rejects the request.
 Raft servers communicateusing remote procedurecalls
 (RPCs), and the basic consensus algorithm requires only
 two types of RPCs. RequestVote RPCs are initiated by
 candidates during elections (Section 5.2), and Append
Entries RPCs are initiated by leaders to replicate log en
tries and to provide a form of heartbeat (Section 5.3). Sec
tion 7 addsathird RPCfortransferringsnapshotsbetween
 servers. Servers retry RPCs if they do not receive a re
sponse in a timely manner,and they issue RPCs in parallel
 for best performance.
 5.2 Leader election
 Raft uses a heartbeat mechanism to trigger leader elec
tion. When servers start up, they begin as followers. A
 server remains in follower state as long as it receives valid
 5
RPCs from a leader or candidate. Leaders send periodic
 heartbeats (AppendEntriesRPCs that carry no log entries)
 to all followers in order to maintain their authority. If a
 follower receives no communicationover a period of time
 called the election timeout, then it assumes there is no vi
able leader and begins an election to choose a new leader.
 To begin an election, a follower increments its current
 term and transitions to candidate state. It then votes for
 itself and issues RequestVote RPCs in parallel to each of
 the other servers in the cluster. A candidate continues in
 this state until one of three things happens: (a) it wins the
 election, (b) another server establishes itself as leader, or
 (c) a period of time goes by with no winner. These out
comes are discussed separately in the paragraphs below.
 A candidate wins an election if it receives votes from
 a majority of the servers in the full cluster for the same
 term. Each server will vote for at most one candidate in a
 given term, on a first-come-first-served basis (note: Sec
tion 5.4 adds an additional restriction on votes). The ma
jority rule ensures that at most one candidate can win the
 election for a particular term (the Election Safety Prop
erty in Figure 3). Once a candidate wins an election, it
 becomes leader. It then sends heartbeat messages to all of
 the other servers to establish its authority and prevent new
 elections.
 While waiting for votes, a candidate may receive an
 AppendEntries RPC from another server claiming to be
 leader. If the leader’s term (included in its RPC) is at least
 as large as the candidate’s current term, then the candidate
 recognizes the leader as legitimate and returns to follower
 state. If the term in the RPC is smaller thanthe candidate’s
 current term, then the candidate rejects the RPC and con
tinues in candidate state.
 The third possible outcome is that a candidate neither
 wins nor loses the election: if many followers become
 candidates at the same time, votes could be split so that
 no candidate obtains a majority. When this happens, each
 candidate will time out and start a new election by incre
menting its term and initiating another round of Request
Vote RPCs. However, without extra measures split votes
 could repeat indefinitely.
 Raft uses randomized election timeouts to ensure that
 split votes are rare and that they are resolved quickly. To
 prevent split votes in the first place, election timeouts are
 chosen randomly from a fixed interval (e.g., 150–300ms).
 This spreads out the servers so that in most cases only a
 single server will time out; it wins the election and sends
 heartbeats before any other servers time out. The same
 mechanism is used to handle split votes. Each candidate
 restarts its randomized election timeout at the start of an
 election, and it waits for that timeout to elapse before
 starting the next election; this reduces the likelihood of
 another split vote in the new election. Section 9.3 shows
 that this approach elects a leader rapidly.
 Figure 6: Logs are composed of entries, which are numbered
 sequentially. Each entry contains the term in which it was
 created (the number in each box) and a command for the state
 machine. Anentry is considered committed if it is safe for that
 entry to be applied to state machines.
 Elections are an example of how understandability
 guided our choice between design alternatives. Initially
 we planned to use a ranking system: each candidate was
 assigned a unique rank, which was used to select between
 competing candidates. If a candidate discovered another
 candidate with higher rank, it would return to follower
 state so that the higher ranking candidate could more eas
ily win the next election. We found that this approach
 created subtle issues around availability (a lower-ranked
 server might need to time out and become a candidate
 again if a higher-ranked server fails, but if it does so too
 soon, it can reset progress towards electing a leader). We
 made adjustments to the algorithm several times, but after
 each adjustment new corner cases appeared. Eventually
 we concluded that the randomized retry approach is more
 obvious and understandable.
 5.3 Logreplication
 Once a leader has been elected, it begins servicing
 client requests. Each client request contains a commandto
 be executed by the replicated state machines. The leader
 appends the command to its log as a new entry, then is
sues AppendEntries RPCs in parallel to each of the other
 servers to replicate the entry. When the entry has been
 safely replicated (as described below), the leader applies
 the entry to its state machine and returns the result of that
 execution to the client. If followers crash or run slowly,
 or if network packets are lost, the leader retries Append
Entries RPCs indefinitely (even after it has responded to
 the client) until all followers eventually store all log en
tries.
 Logs are organized as shown in Figure 6. Each log en
try stores a state machine command along with the term
 number when the entry was received by the leader. The
 term numbers in log entries are used to detect inconsis
tencies between logs and to ensure some of the properties
 in Figure 3. Each log entry also has an integer index iden
6
tifying its position in the log.
 The leader decides when it is safe to apply a log en
try to the state machines; such an entry is called commit
ted. Raft guarantees that committed entries are durable
 and will eventually be executed by all of the available
 state machines. A log entry is committed once the leader
 that created the entry has replicated it on a majority of
 the servers (e.g., entry 7 in Figure 6). This also commits
 all preceding entries in the leader’s log, including entries
 created by previous leaders. Section 5.4 discusses some
 subtleties when applying this rule after leader changes,
 and it also shows that this definition of commitment is
 safe. The leader keeps track of the highest index it knows
 to be committed, and it includes that index in future
 AppendEntries RPCs (including heartbeats) so that the
 other servers eventually find out. Once a follower learns
 that a log entry is committed, it applies the entry to its
 local state machine (in log order).
 WedesignedtheRaft log mechanismto maintainahigh
 level of coherency between the logs on different servers.
 Not only does this simplify the system’s behavior and
 makeitmorepredictable,but it is an importantcomponent
 of ensuring safety. Raft maintains the following proper
ties, which together constitute the Log Matching Property
 in Figure 3:
 • If two entries in different logs have the same index
 and term, then they store the same command.
 • If two entries in different logs have the same index
 and term, then the logs are identical in all preceding
 entries.
 The first property follows from the fact that a leader
 creates at most one entry with a given log index in a given
 term, and log entries never change their position in the
 log. The second property is guaranteed by a simple con
sistency check performed by AppendEntries. When send
ing an AppendEntries RPC, the leader includes the index
 and term of the entry in its log that immediately precedes
 the new entries. If the follower does not find an entry in
 its log with the same index and term, then it refuses the
 new entries. The consistency check acts as an induction
 step: the initial empty state of the logs satisfies the Log
 Matching Property, and the consistency check preserves
 the Log Matching Property whenever logs are extended.
 Asaresult, wheneverAppendEntriesreturns successfully,
 the leader knows that the follower’s log is identical to its
 own log up through the new entries.
 During normal operation, the logs of the leader and
 followers stay consistent, so the AppendEntries consis
tency check neverfails. However, leader crashes can leave
 the logs inconsistent (the old leader may not have fully
 replicated all of the entries in its log). These inconsisten
cies can compound over a series of leader and follower
 crashes. Figure 7 illustrates the ways in which followers’
 logs may differ from that of a new leader. A follower may
 Figure 7: When the leader at the top comes to power, it is
 possible that any of scenarios (a–f) could occur in follower
 logs. Each box represents one log entry; the number in the
 box is its term. A follower may be missing entries (a–b), may
 have extra uncommitted entries (c–d), or both (e–f). For ex
ample, scenario (f) could occur if that server was the leader
 for term 2, added several entries to its log, then crashed before
 committing any of them; it restarted quickly, became leader
 for term 3, and added a few more entries to its log; before any
 of the entries in either term 2 or term 3 were committed, the
 server crashed again and remained down for several terms.
 be missing entries that are present on the leader, it may
 have extra entries that are not present on the leader, or
 both. Missing and extraneous entries in a log may span
 multiple terms.
 In Raft, the leader handles inconsistencies by forcing
 the followers’ logs to duplicate its own. This means that
 conflicting entries in follower logs will be overwritten
 with entries from the leader’s log. Section 5.4 will show
 that this is safe when coupled with one more restriction.
 To bring a follower’s log into consistency with its own,
 the leader must find the latest log entry where the two
 logs agree, delete any entries in the follower’s log after
 that point, and send the follower all of the leader’s entries
 after that point. All of these actions happen in response
 to the consistency check performed by AppendEntries
 RPCs. Theleadermaintainsa nextIndex for each follower,
 which is the index of the next log entry the leader will
 send to that follower. When a leader first comes to power,
 it initializes all nextIndex values to the index just after the
 last one in its log (11 in Figure 7). If a follower’s log is
 inconsistent with the leader’s, the AppendEntries consis
tency check will fail in the next AppendEntries RPC. Af
ter a rejection, the leader decrements nextIndexand retries
 the AppendEntries RPC. Eventually nextIndex will reach
 a point where the leader and follower logs match. When
 this happens,AppendEntrieswill succeed, which removes
 any conflicting entries in the follower’s log and appends
 entries from the leader’s log (if any). Once AppendEntries
 succeeds, the follower’s log is consistent with the leader’s,
 and it will remain that way for the rest of the term.
 If desired, the protocol can be optimized to reduce the
 number of rejected AppendEntries RPCs. For example,
 when rejecting an AppendEntries request, the follower
 7
can include the term of the conflicting entry and the first
 index it stores for that term. With this information, the
 leader can decrement nextIndex to bypass all of the con
f
 licting entries in that term; one AppendEntries RPC will
 be required for each term with conflicting entries, rather
 than one RPC per entry. In practice, we doubt this opti
mization is necessary, since failures happen infrequently
 and it is unlikely that there will be many inconsistent en
tries.
 With this mechanism,aleader doesnotneedto take any
 special actions to restore log consistency when it comes to
 power. It just begins normal operation, and the logs auto
matically converge in response to failures of the Append
Entries consistency check. A leader never overwrites or
 deletes entries in its own log (the Leader Append-Only
 Property in Figure 3).
 This log replication mechanism exhibits the desirable
 consensus properties described in Section 2: Raft can ac
cept, replicate, and apply new log entries as long as a ma
jority of the servers are up; in the normal case a new entry
 can be replicated with a single round of RPCs to a ma
jority of the cluster; and a single slow follower will not
 impact performance.
 5.4 Safety
 The previous sections described how Raft elects lead
ers and replicates log entries. However, the mechanisms
 described so far are not quite sufficient to ensure that each
 state machine executes exactly the same commands in the
 same order. For example, a follower might be unavailable
 while the leader commits several log entries, then it could
 be elected leader and overwrite these entries with new
 ones; as a result, different state machines might execute
 different command sequences.
 This section completes the Raft algorithm by adding a
 restriction on which servers may be elected leader. The
 restriction ensures that the leader for any given term con
tains all of the entries committed in previous terms (the
 Leader Completeness Property from Figure 3). Given the
 election restriction, we then make the rules for commit
ment more precise. Finally, we present a proof sketch for
 the Leader Completeness Property and show how it leads
 to correct behavior of the replicated state machine.
 5.4.1 Election restriction
 In any leader-based consensus algorithm, the leader
 must eventually store all of the committed log entries. In
 some consensus algorithms, such as Viewstamped Repli
cation [22], a leader can be elected even if it doesn’t
 initially contain all of the committed entries. These al
gorithms contain additional mechanisms to identify the
 missing entries and transmit them to the new leader, ei
ther during the election process or shortly afterwards. Un
fortunately, this results in considerable additional mecha
nism and complexity. Raft uses a simpler approach where
 it guarantees that all the committed entries from previous
 Figure 8: A time sequence showing why a leader cannot de
termine commitment using log entries from older terms. In
 (a) S1 is leader and partially replicates the log entry at index
 2. In (b) S1 crashes; S5 is elected leader for term 3 with votes
 from S3, S4, and itself, and accepts a different entry at log
 index 2. In (c) S5 crashes; S1 restarts, is elected leader, and
 continues replication. At this point, the log entry from term 2
 has been replicated on a majority of the servers, but it is not
 committed. If S1 crashes as in (d), S5 could be elected leader
 (with votes from S2, S3, and S4) and overwrite the entry with
 its own entry from term 3. However, if S1 replicates an en
try from its current term on a majority of the servers before
 crashing, as in (e), then this entry is committed (S5 cannot
 win an election). At this point all preceding entries in the log
 are committed as well.
 terms are present on each new leader from the moment of
 its election, without the need to transfer those entries to
 the leader. This means that log entries only flow in one di
rection, from leaders to followers, and leaders never over
write existing entries in their logs.
 Raft uses the voting processto preventa candidatefrom
 winning an election unless its log contains all committed
 entries. A candidate must contact a majority of the cluster
 in order to be elected, which means that every committed
 entry must bepresent in at least one of those servers.If the
 candidate’s log is at least as up-to-date as any other log
 in that majority (where “up-to-date” is defined precisely
 below), then it will hold all the committed entries. The
 RequestVote RPC implements this restriction: the RPC
 includes information about the candidate’s log, and the
 voter denies its vote if its own log is more up-to-date than
 that of the candidate.
 Raft determines which of two logs is more up-to-date
 by comparing the index and term of the last entries in the
 logs. If the logs have last entries with different terms, then
 the log with the later term is more up-to-date. If the logs
 end with the same term, then whichever log is longer is
 more up-to-date.
 5.4.2 Committing entries from previous terms
 As described in Section 5.3, a leader knows that an en
try from its current term is committed once that entry is
 stored on a majority of the servers. If a leader crashes be
fore committing an entry, future leaders will attempt to
 f
 inish replicating the entry. However, a leader cannot im
mediately conclude that an entry from a previous term is
 committed once it is stored on a majority of servers. Fig
8
Figure 9: If S1 (leader for term T) commits a new log entry
 from its term, and S5 is elected leader for a later term U, then
 there must be at least one server (S3) that accepted the log
 entry and also voted for S5.
 ure 8 illustrates a situation where an old log entry is stored
 on a majority of servers, yet can still be overwritten by a
 future leader.
 To eliminate problems like the one in Figure 8, Raft
 never commits log entries from previous terms by count
ing replicas. Only log entries from the leader’s current
 term are committed by counting replicas; once an entry
 from the current term has been committed in this way,
 then all prior entries are committed indirectly because
 of the Log Matching Property. There are some situations
 where a leader could safely conclude that an older log en
try is committed (for example,if that entry is stored on ev
ery server), but Raft takes a more conservative approach
 for simplicity.
 Raft incurs this extra complexity in the commitment
 rules because log entries retain their original term num
bers when a leader replicates entries from previous
 terms. In other consensus algorithms, if a new leader re
replicates entries from prior “terms,” it must do so with
 its new “term number.” Raft’s approach makes it easier
 to reason about log entries, since they maintain the same
 term number over time and across logs. In addition, new
 leaders in Raft send fewer log entries from previous terms
 than in other algorithms (other algorithms must send re
dundant log entries to renumber them before they can be
 committed).
 5.4.3 Safety argument
 Given the complete Raft algorithm, we can now ar
gue more precisely that the Leader Completeness Prop
erty holds (this argument is based on the safety proof; see
 Section 9.2). We assume that the Leader Completeness
 Property does not hold, then we prove a contradiction.
 Suppose the leader for term T (leaderT) commits a log
 entry from its term, but that log entry is not stored by the
 leader of some future term. Consider the smallest term U
 >Twhoseleader (leaderU) does not store the entry.
 1. The committed entry must have been absent from
 leaderU’s log at the time of its election (leaders never
 delete or overwrite entries).
 2. leaderT replicated the entry on a majority of the clus
ter, and leaderU received votes from a majority of
 the cluster. Thus, at least one server (“the voter”)
 both accepted the entry from leaderT and voted for
 leaderU, as shown in Figure 9. The voter is key to
 reaching a contradiction.
 3. The voter must have accepted the committed entry
 from leaderT before voting for leaderU; otherwise it
 would have rejected the AppendEntries request from
 leaderT (its current term would havebeen higherthan
 T).
 4. The voter still stored the entry when it voted for
 leaderU, since every intervening leader contained the
 entry (by assumption), leaders never remove entries,
 and followers only remove entries if they conflict
 with the leader.
 5. The voter granted its vote to leaderU, so leaderU’s
 log must have been as up-to-date as the voter’s. This
 leads to one of two contradictions.
 6. First, if the voter and leaderU shared the same last
 log term, then leaderU’s log must have been at least
 as long as the voter’s, so its log contained every entry
 in the voter’s log. This is a contradiction, since the
 voter contained the committed entry and leaderU was
 assumed not to.
 7. Otherwise, leaderU’s last log term must have been
 larger than the voter’s. Moreover, it was larger than
 T, since the voter’s last log term was at least T (itcon
tains the committed entry from term T). The earlier
 leader that created leaderU’s last log entry must have
 contained the committed entry in its log (by assump
tion). Then, by the Log Matching Property,leaderU’s
 log must also contain the committed entry, which is
 a contradiction.
 8. This completes the contradiction. Thus, the leaders
 of all terms greater than T must contain all entries
 from term T that are committed in term T.
 9. The Log Matching Property guarantees that future
 leaders will also contain entries that are committed
 indirectly, such as index 2 in Figure 8(d).
 Given the Leader Completeness Property,we can prove
 the State Machine Safety Property from Figure 3, which
 states that if a server has applied a log entry at a given
 index to its state machine,no other server will everapply a
 different log entry for the same index. At the time a server
 applies a log entry to its state machine, its log must be
 identical to the leader’s log up through that entry and the
 entry must be committed. Now consider the lowest term
 in which any server applies a given log index; the Log
 Completeness Property guarantees that the leaders for all
 higher terms will store that same log entry, so servers that
 apply the index in later terms will apply the same value.
 Thus, the State Machine Safety Property holds.
 Finally, Raft requires servers to apply entries in log in
dex order. Combined with the State Machine Safety Prop
erty, this means that all servers will apply exactly the same
 set of log entries to their state machines, in the same order.

5.5 Follower and candidate crashes
 Until this point we have focused on leader failures. Fol
lower and candidate crashes are much simpler to han
dle than leader crashes, and they are both handled in the
 same way. If a follower or candidate crashes, then fu
ture RequestVote and AppendEntries RPCs sent to it will
 fail. Raft handles these failures by retrying indefinitely;
 if the crashed server restarts, then the RPC will complete
 successfully. If a server crashes after completing an RPC
 but before responding, then it will receive the same RPC
 again after it restarts. Raft RPCs are idempotent, so this
 causes no harm. For example, if a follower receives an
 AppendEntries request that includes log entries already
 present in its log, it ignores those entries in the new re
quest.
 5.6 Timing and availability
 One of our requirements for Raft is that safety must
 not depend on timing: the system must not produceincor
rect results just because some event happensmore quickly
 or slowly than expected. However, availability (the ability
 of the system to respond to clients in a timely manner)
 must inevitably depend on timing. For example, if mes
sage exchanges take longer than the typical time between
 server crashes, candidates will not stay up long enough to
 winanelection; withouta steady leader, Raft cannotmake
 progress.
 Leader election is the aspect of Raft where timing is
 most critical. Raft will be able to elect and maintain a
 steady leader as long as the system satisfies the follow
ing timing requirement:
 broadcastTime ≪ electionTimeout ≪ MTBF
 In this inequality broadcastTime is the average time it
 takes a server to send RPCs in parallel to every server
 in the cluster and receive their responses; electionTime
out is the election timeout described in Section 5.2; and
 MTBF is the average time between failures for a single
 server. The broadcast time should be an order of mag
nitude less than the election timeout so that leaders can
 reliably send the heartbeat messages required to keep fol
lowers from starting elections; given the randomized ap
proach used for election timeouts, this inequality also
 makessplit votes unlikely. The election timeout should be
 a fewordersof magnitudeless than MTBFso that the sys
tem makes steady progress. When the leader crashes, the
 system will be unavailable for roughly the election time
out; we would like this to represent only a small fraction
 of overall time.
 The broadcast time and MTBF are properties of the un
derlying system, while the election timeout is something
 we must choose. Raft’s RPCs typically require the recip
ient to persist information to stable storage, so the broad
cast time may range from 0.5ms to 20ms, depending on
 storage technology. As a result, the election timeout is
 likely to be somewherebetween10msand500ms.Typical
 Figure 10: Switching directly from one configuration to an
other is unsafe because different servers will switch at dif
ferent times. In this example, the cluster grows from three
 servers to five. Unfortunately, there is a point in time where
 two different leaders can be elected for the same term, one
 with a majority of the old configuration (Cold) and another
 with a majority of the new configuration (Cnew).
 server MTBFs are several months or more, which easily
 satisfies the timing requirement.
 6 Cluster membership changes
 Up until now we have assumed that the cluster config
uration (the set of servers participating in the consensus
 algorithm) is fixed. In practice, it will occasionally be nec
essary to change the configuration,for example to replace
 servers when they fail or to change the degree of replica
tion. Althoughthis can be donebytakingthe entire cluster
 off-line, updating configuration files, and then restarting
 the cluster, this would leave the cluster unavailable dur
ing the changeover. In addition, if there are any manual
 steps, they risk operator error. In order to avoid these is
sues, we decided to automate configuration changes and
 incorporate them into the Raft consensus algorithm.
 For the configuration change mechanism to be safe,
 there must be no point during the transition where it
 is possible for two leaders to be elected for the same
 term. Unfortunately, any approach where servers switch
 directly from the old configuration to the new configura
tion is unsafe. It isn’t possible to atomically switch all of
 the servers at once, so the cluster can potentially split into
 two independent majorities during the transition (see Fig
ure 10).
 In order to ensure safety, configuration changes must
 use a two-phase approach. There are a variety of ways
 to implement the two phases. For example, some systems
 (e.g., [22]) use the first phase to disable the old configura
tion so it cannot process client requests; then the second
 phase enables the new configuration. In Raft the cluster
 f
 irst switches to a transitional configuration we call joint
 consensus; once the joint consensus has been committed,
 the system then transitions to the new configuration. The
 joint consensus combines both the old and new configu
rations:
 • Log entries are replicated to all servers in both con
f
 igurations.
 10
Figure 11: Timeline for a configuration change. Dashed lines
 show configuration entries that have been created but not
 committed, and solidlines show the latest committed configu
ration entry. The leader first creates the Cold,new configuration
 entry in its log and commits it to Cold,new (a majority of Cold
 and a majority of Cnew). Then it creates the Cnew entry and
 commits it to a majority of Cnew. There is no point in time in
 which Cold and Cnew can both make decisions independently.
 • Any server from either configuration may serve as
 leader.
 • Agreement(for elections and entry commitment) re
quires separate majorities from both the old and new
 configurations.
 Thejoint consensus allows individual servers to transition
 between configurations at different times without com
promising safety. Furthermore, joint consensus allows the
 cluster to continue servicing client requests throughout
 the configuration change.
 Cluster configurations are stored and communicated
 using special entries in the replicated log; Figure 11 illus
trates the configuration change process. When the leader
 receives a request to change the configuration from Cold
 to Cnew, it stores the configuration for joint consensus
 (Cold,new in the figure) as a log entry and replicates that
 entry using the mechanisms described previously. Once a
 given server adds the new configuration entry to its log,
 it uses that configuration for all future decisions (a server
 always uses the latest configuration in its log, regardless
 of whether the entry is committed). This means that the
 leader will use the rules of Cold,new to determine when the
 log entry for Cold,new is committed. If the leader crashes,
 a new leader may be chosen under either Cold or Cold,new,
 depending on whether the winning candidate has received
 Cold,new. In any case, Cnew cannot make unilateral deci
sions during this period.
 OnceCold,new has beencommitted,neitherCold norCnew
 can make decisions without approval of the other, and the
 Leader Completeness Property ensures that only servers
 with the Cold,new log entry can be elected as leader. It is
 now safe for the leader to create a log entry describing
 Cnew and replicate it to the cluster. Again, this configura
tion will take effect on each server as soon as it is seen.
 When the new configuration has been committed under
 the rules of Cnew, the old configuration is irrelevant and
 servers not in the new configuration can be shut down. As
 shown in Figure 11, there is no time when Cold and Cnew
 can both makeunilateral decisions; this guarantees safety.
 There are three more issues to address for reconfigura
tion. The first issue is that new servers may not initially
 store any log entries. If they are added to the cluster in
 this state, it could take quite a while for them to catch
 up, during which time it might not be possible to com
mit new log entries. In order to avoid availability gaps,
 Raft introduces an additional phase before the configu
ration change, in which the new servers join the cluster
 as non-voting members (the leader replicates log entries
 to them, but they are not considered for majorities). Once
 the newservers have caughtup with the rest of the cluster,
 the reconfiguration can proceed as described above.
 The second issue is that the cluster leader may not be
 part of the new configuration.In this case, the leader steps
 down(returns to follower state) once it has committed the
 Cnew log entry. This means that there will be a period of
 time (while it is committingCnew) when the leader is man
aging a cluster that does not include itself; it replicates log
 entries but does not count itself in majorities. The leader
 transition occurs when Cnew is committed because this is
 the first point when the new configuration can operate in
dependently (it will always be possible to choose a leader
 fromCnew). Before this point, it may be the case that only
 a server fromCold can be elected leader.
 The third issue is that removed servers (those not in
 Cnew) can disrupt the cluster. These servers will not re
ceive heartbeats, so they will time out and start new elec
tions. They will then send RequestVote RPCs with new
 term numbers, and this will cause the current leader to
 revert to follower state. A new leader will eventually be
 elected, but the removed servers will time out again and
 the process will repeat, resulting in poor availability.
 To prevent this problem, servers disregard RequestVote
 RPCs when they believe a current leader exists. Specif
ically, if a server receives a RequestVote RPC within
 the minimum election timeout of hearing from a cur
rent leader, it does not update its term or grant its vote.
 This does not affect normal elections, where each server
 waits at least a minimum election timeout before starting
 an election. However, it helps avoid disruptions from re
moved servers: if a leader is able to get heartbeats to its
 cluster, then it will not be deposed by larger term num
bers.
 7 Logcompaction
 Raft’s log grows during normal operation to incorpo
rate more client requests, but in a practical system, it can
not grow without bound. As the log grows longer, it oc
cupies more space and takes more time to replay. This
 will eventually cause availability problems without some
 mechanism to discard obsolete information that has accu
mulated in the log.
 Snapshotting is the simplest approach to compaction.
 In snapshotting, the entire current system state is written
 to a snapshot on stable storage, then the entire log up to
 11
Figure 12: A server replaces the committed entries in its log
 (indexes 1 through 5) with a new snapshot, which stores just
 the current state (variables x and y in this example). The snap
shot’s last included index and term serve to position the snap
shot in the log preceding entry 6.
 that point is discarded. Snapshotting is used in Chubby
 and ZooKeeper, and the remainder of this section de
scribes snapshotting in Raft.
 Incremental approaches to compaction, such as log
 cleaning [36] and log-structured merge trees [30, 5], are
 also possible. These operate on a fraction of the data at
 once, so they spread the load of compaction more evenly
 over time. They first select a region of data that has ac
cumulated many deleted and overwritten objects, then
 they rewrite the live objects from that region more com
pactly and free the region. This requires significant addi
tional mechanism and complexity compared to snapshot
ting, which simplifies the problem by always operating
 on the entire data set. While log cleaning would require
 modificationsto Raft, state machinescan implementLSM
 trees using the same interface as snapshotting.
 Figure 12 shows the basic idea of snapshotting in Raft.
 Each server takes snapshots independently, covering just
 the committed entries in its log. Most of the work con
sists of the state machine writing its current state to the
 snapshot. Raft also includes a small amount of metadata
 in the snapshot: the last included index is the index of the
 last entry in the log that the snapshot replaces (the last en
try the state machine had applied), and the last included
 term is the term of this entry. These are preserved to sup
port the AppendEntries consistency check for the first log
 entry following the snapshot, since that entry needs a pre
vious log index and term. To enable cluster membership
 changes (Section 6), the snapshot also includes the latest
 configuration in the log as of last included index. Once a
 server completes writing a snapshot, it may delete all log
 entries up through the last included index, as well as any
 prior snapshot.
 Although servers normally take snapshots indepen
dently, the leader must occasionally send snapshots to
 followers that lag behind. This happens when the leader
 has already discarded the next log entry that it needs to
 send to a follower. Fortunately, this situation is unlikely
 in normal operation: a follower that has kept up with the

 timer.
 leader would already have this entry. However, an excep
tionally slow follower or a new server joining the cluster
 (Section 6) would not. The way to bring such a follower
 up-to-date is for the leader to send it a snapshot over the
 network.
 The leader uses a new RPC called InstallSnapshot to
 send snapshots to followers that are too far behind; see
 Figure 13. When a follower receives a snapshot with this
 RPC, it must decide what to do with its existing log en
tries. Usually the snapshot will contain new information
 not already in the recipient’s log. In this case, the follower
 discards its entire log; it is all superseded by the snapshot
 and may possibly have uncommitted entries that conflict
 with the snapshot. If instead the follower receives a snap
shot that describes a prefix of its log (due to retransmis
sion or by mistake), then log entries covered by the snap
shot are deleted but entries following the snapshot are still
 valid and must be retained.
 This snapshotting approach departs from Raft’s strong
 leader principle, since followers can take snapshots with
out the knowledge of the leader. However, we think this
 departure is justified. While having a leader helps avoid
 conflicting decisions in reaching consensus, consensus
 has already been reached when snapshotting, so no de
cisions conflict. Data still only flows from leaders to fol
12
lowers, just followers can now reorganize their data.
 We considered an alternative leader-based approach in
 which only the leader would create a snapshot, then it
 would send this snapshot to each of its followers. How
ever, this has two disadvantages. First, sending the snap
shot to eachfollower would waste networkbandwidthand
 slow the snapshotting process. Each follower already has
 the information needed to produce its own snapshots, and
 it is typically much cheaper for a server to producea snap
shot from its local state than it is to send and receive one
 over the network. Second, the leader’s implementation
 would be more complex. For example, the leader would
 need to send snapshots to followers in parallel with repli
cating new log entries to them, so as not to block new
 client requests.
 Thereare two moreissues thatimpactsnapshottingper
formance. First, servers must decide when to snapshot. If
 a server snapshots too often, it wastes disk bandwidth and
 energy; if it snapshots too infrequently, it risks exhaust
ing its storage capacity, and it increases the time required
 to replay the log during restarts. One simple strategy is
 to take a snapshot when the log reaches a fixed size in
 bytes. If this size is set to be significantly larger than the
 expected size of a snapshot, then the disk bandwidthover
head for snapshotting will be small.
 The second performance issue is that writing a snap
shot can take a significant amount of time, and we do
 not want this to delay normal operations. The solution is
 to use copy-on-write techniques so that new updates can
 be accepted without impacting the snapshot being writ
ten. For example,state machinesbuilt with functionaldata
 structures naturally support this. Alternatively, the operat
ing system’s copy-on-write support (e.g., fork on Linux)
 can be used to create an in-memory snapshot of the entire
 state machine (our implementation uses this approach).
 8 Client interaction
 This section describes how clients interact with Raft,
 including how clients find the cluster leader and how Raft
 supports linearizable semantics [10]. These issues apply
 to all consensus-based systems, and Raft’s solutions are
 similar to other systems.
 Clients of Raft send all of their requests to the leader.
 When a client first starts up, it connects to a randomly
chosen server. If the client’s first choice is not the leader,
 that server will reject the client’s request and supply in
formation about the most recent leader it has heard from
 (AppendEntries requests include the network address of
 the leader). If the leader crashes, client requests will time
 out; clients then try again with randomly-chosen servers.
 Our goal for Raft is to implement linearizable seman
tics (each operation appears to execute instantaneously,
 exactly once, at some point between its invocation and
 its response). However, as described so far Raft can exe
cute a commandmultiple times: for example, if the leader
 crashes after committing the log entry but before respond
ing to the client, the client will retry the command with a
 new leader, causing it to be executed a second time. The
 solution is for clients to assign unique serial numbers to
 every command. Then, the state machine tracks the latest
 serial number processed for each client, along with the as
sociated response. If it receives a command whose serial
 number has already been executed, it responds immedi
ately without re-executing the request.
 Read-only operations can be handled without writing
 anything into the log. However, with no additional mea
sures, this would run the risk of returning stale data, since
 the leader responding to the request might have been su
perseded by a newer leader of which it is unaware. Lin
earizable reads must not return stale data, and Raft needs
 two extra precautions to guarantee this without using the
 log. First, a leader must have the latest information on
 which entries are committed. The Leader Completeness
 Property guarantees that a leader has all committed en
tries, but at the start of its term, it may not know which
 those are. To find out, it needs to commit an entry from
 its term. Raft handles this by having each leader com
mit a blank no-op entry into the log at the start of its
 term. Second, a leader must check whether it has been de
posed before processing a read-only request (its informa
tion maybe stale if a morerecentleader has beenelected).
 Raft handles this by having the leader exchange heart
beat messages with a majority of the cluster before re
sponding to read-only requests. Alternatively, the leader
 could rely on the heartbeat mechanism to provide a form
 of lease [9], but this would rely on timing for safety (it
 assumes bounded clock skew).
 9 Implementation and evaluation
 We have implemented Raft as part of a replicated
 state machine that stores configuration information for
 RAMCloud[33] and assists in failover of the RAMCloud
 coordinator. The Raft implementation contains roughly
 2000 lines of C++ code, not including tests, comments, or
 blanklines. The sourcecodeis freely available[23]. There
 are also about 25 independentthird-party open source im
plementations [34] of Raft in various stages of develop
ment, based on drafts of this paper. Also, various compa
nies are deploying Raft-based systems [34].
 Theremainderof this section evaluates Raft using three
 criteria: understandability, correctness, and performance.
 9.1 Understandability

 lecture covered enough material to create an equivalent
 replicated state machine, including single-decree Paxos,
 multi-decree Paxos, reconfiguration, and a few optimiza
tions needed in practice (such as leader election). The
 quizzes tested basic understanding of the algorithms and
 also required students to reason about corner cases. Each
 student watched one video, took the corresponding quiz,
 watched the second video, and took the second quiz.
 About half of the participants did the Paxos portion first
 and the other half did the Raft portion first in order to
 account for both individual differences in performance
 and experience gained from the first portion of the study.
 We compared participants’ scores on each quiz to deter
mine whether participants showed a better understanding
 of Raft.
 We tried to make the comparison between Paxos and
 Raft as fair as possible. The experiment favored Paxos in
 two ways: 15 of the 43 participants reported having some
 prior experience with Paxos, and the Paxos video is 14%
 longer than the Raft video. As summarized in Table 1, we
 have taken steps to mitigate potential sources of bias. All
 of our materials are available for review [28, 31].
 Onaverage,participants scored 4.9 points higher on the
 Raft quiz than on the Paxos quiz (out of a possible 60
 points, the mean Raft score was 25.7 and the mean Paxos
 score was 20.8); Figure 14 shows their individual scores.
 A paired t-test states that, with 95% confidence, the true
 distribution of Raft scores has a mean at least 2.5 points
 larger than the true distribution of Paxos scores.
 We also created a linear regression model that predicts
 a new student’s quiz scores based on three factors: which
 quiz they took, their degree of prior Paxos experience,and

 the order in which they learned the algorithms.The model
 predicts that the choice of quiz produces a 12.5-point dif
ference in favor of Raft. This is significantly higher than
 the observed difference of 4.9 points, because many of the
 actual students had prior Paxos experience, which helped
 Paxos considerably, whereas it helped Raft slightly less.
 Curiously, the model also predicts scores 6.3 points lower
 on Raft for people that have already taken the Paxos quiz;
 although we don’t know why, this does appear to be sta
tistically significant.
 We also surveyed participants after their quizzes to see
 which algorithm they felt would be easier to implement
 or explain; these results are shown in Figure 15. An over
whelming majority of participants reported Raft would be
 easier to implement and explain (33 of 41 for each ques
tion). However, these self-reported feelings may be less
 reliable than participants’ quiz scores, and participants
 may have been biased by knowledge of our hypothesis
 that Raft is easier to understand.

 at [31].
 9.2 Correctness
 We have developed a formal specification and a proof
 of safety for the consensus mechanism described in Sec
tion 5. The formal specification [31] makes the informa
tion summarized in Figure 2 completely precise using the
 TLA+ specification language [17]. It is about 400 lines
 long and serves as the subject of the proof. It is also use
ful on its own for anyone implementing Raft. We have
 mechanically proven the Log Completeness Property us
ing the TLA proof system [7]. However, this proof relies
 on invariants that have not been mechanically checked
 (for example, we have not proven the type safety of the
 specification). Furthermore, we have written an informal
 proof [31] of the State Machine Safety property which
 is complete (it relies on the specification alone) and rela

 tively precise (it is about 3500 words long).
 9.3 Performance
 Raft’s performance is similar to other consensus algo
rithms such as Paxos. The most important case for per
formance is when an established leader is replicating new
 log entries. Raft achieves this using the minimal number
 of messages(a singleround-tripfrom theleader to half the
 cluster). It is also possible to further improve Raft’s per
formance. For example, it easily supports batching and
 pipelining requests for higher throughput and lower la
tency. Various optimizations have been proposed in the
 literature for other algorithms; many of these could be ap
plied to Raft, but we leave this to future work.
 We used our Raft implementation to measure the per
formance of Raft’s leader election algorithm and answer
 two questions. First, does the election process converge
 quickly? Second, what is the minimumdowntimethat can
 be achieved after leader crashes?
 To measure leader election, we repeatedly crashed the
 leader of a cluster of five servers and timed how long it
 took to detect the crash and elect a new leader (see Fig
ure 16). To generate a worst-case scenario, the servers in
 each trial had different log lengths, so some candidates
 were not eligible to become leader. Furthermore, to en
courage split votes, our test script triggered a synchro
nized broadcast of heartbeat RPCs from the leader before
 terminating its process (this approximates the behavior
 of the leader replicating a new log entry prior to crash
ing). The leader was crashed uniformly randomly within
 its heartbeat interval, which was half of the minimum
 election timeout for all tests. Thus, the smallest possible
 downtime was about half of the minimum election time
out.
 The top graph in Figure 16 shows that a small amount
 of randomization in the election timeout is enough to
 avoid split votes in elections. In the absence of random
ness, leader election consistently took longer than 10 sec
onds in our tests due to many split votes. Adding just 5ms
 of randomness helps significantly, resulting in a median
 downtime of 287ms. Using more randomness improves
 worst-case behavior: with 50ms of randomnessthe worst
case completion time (over 1000 trials) was 513ms.
 The bottom graph in Figure 16 shows that downtime
 can be reduced by reducing the election timeout. With
 an election timeout of 12–24ms, it takes only 35ms on
 average to elect a leader (the longest trial took 152ms).
 However,loweringthe timeoutsbeyondthis point violates
 Raft’s timing requirement: leaders have difficulty broad
casting heartbeats before other servers start new elections.
 This can cause unnecessary leader changes and lower
 overall system availability. We recommend using a con
servative election timeout such as 150–300ms;such time
outs are unlikely to cause unnecessary leader changes and
 will still provide good availability.

 There have been numerous publications related to con
sensus algorithms, many of which fall into one of the fol
lowing categories:
 • Lamport’s original description of Paxos [15], and at
tempts to explain it more clearly [16, 20, 21].
 • Elaborations of Paxos, which fill in missing details
 and modify the algorithm to provide a better founda
tion for implementation [26, 39, 13].
 • Systems that implement consensus algorithms, such
 as Chubby [2, 4], ZooKeeper [11, 12], and Span
ner [6]. The algorithms for Chubby and Spanner
 have not been published in detail, though both claim
 to be based on Paxos. ZooKeeper’s algorithm has
 been published in moredetail, but it is quite different
 from Paxos.
 • Performance optimizations that can be applied to
 Paxos [18, 19, 3, 25, 1, 27].
 • OkiandLiskov’sViewstampedReplication (VR), an
 alternative approach to consensus developed around
 the same timeas Paxos.Theoriginaldescription [29]
 was intertwined with a protocol for distributed trans
actions, but the core consensus protocol has been
 separated in a recent update [22]. VR uses a leader
based approach with many similarities to Raft.
 The greatest difference between Raft and Paxos is
 Raft’s strong leadership: Raft uses leader election as an
 essential part of the consensus protocol, and it concen
15
trates as much functionality as possible in the leader. This
 approach results in a simpler algorithm that is easier to
 understand. For example, in Paxos, leader election is or
thogonal to the basic consensus protocol: it serves only as
 a performanceoptimization andis notrequiredfor achiev
ing consensus. However, this results in additional mecha
nism: Paxos includes both a two-phase protocol for basic
 consensus and a separate mechanism for leader election.
 In contrast, Raft incorporates leader election directly into
 the consensus algorithm and uses it as the first of the two
 phases of consensus. This results in less mechanism than
 in Paxos.
 Like Raft, VR and ZooKeeper are leader-based and
 therefore share many of Raft’s advantages over Paxos.
 However, Raft has less mechanism that VR or ZooKeeper
 because it minimizes the functionality in non-leaders. For
 example, log entries in Raft flow in only one direction:
 outward from the leader in AppendEntries RPCs. In VR
 log entries flow in both directions (leaders can receive
 log entries during the election process); this results in
 additional mechanism and complexity. The published de
scription of ZooKeeper also transfers log entries both to
 and from the leader, but the implementation is apparently
 more like Raft [35].
 Raft has fewer message types than any other algo
rithm for consensus-based log replication that we are
 aware of. For example, we counted the message types VR
 and ZooKeeper use for basic consensus and membership
 changes (excluding log compaction and client interaction,
 as these are nearly independent of the algorithms). VR
 and ZooKeeper each define 10 different message types,
 while Raft has only 4 message types (two RPC requests
 and their responses). Raft’s messages are a bit more dense
 than the other algorithms’, but they are simpler collec
tively. In addition, VR and ZooKeeper are described in
 terms of transmitting entire logs during leader changes;
 additional message types will be required to optimize
 these mechanisms so that they are practical.
 Raft’s strong leadership approach simplifies the algo
rithm, but it precludes some performance optimizations.
 For example, Egalitarian Paxos (EPaxos) can achieve
 higher performance under some conditions with a lead
erless approach [27]. EPaxos exploits commutativity in
 state machine commands. Any server can commit a com
mand with just one round of communication as long as
 other commandsthat are proposed concurrently commute
 with it. However, if commands that are proposed con
currently do not commute with each other, EPaxos re
quires an additional round of communication. Because
 any server may commit commands,EPaxosbalances load
 well between servers and is able to achieve lower latency
 than Raft in WAN settings. However, it adds significant
 complexity to Paxos.
 Several different approaches for cluster member
ship changes have been proposed or implemented in
 other work, including Lamport’s original proposal [15],
 VR[22], and SMART [24]. We chose the joint consensus
 approach for Raft because it leverages the rest of the con
sensus protocol, so that very little additional mechanism
 is required for membership changes. Lamport’s α-based
 approach was not an option for Raft because it assumes
 consensus can be reached without a leader. In comparison
 to VR and SMART, Raft’s reconfiguration algorithm has
 the advantage that membership changes can occur with
out limiting the processing of normal requests; in con
trast, VR stops all normal processing during configura
tion changes, and SMART imposes an α-like limit on the
 numberofoutstandingrequests. Raft’s approachalso adds
 less mechanism than either VR or SMART.
 11 Conclusion
 Algorithms are often designed with correctness, effi
ciency, and/or conciseness as the primary goals. Although
 these are all worthy goals, we believe that understandabil
ity is just as important. None of the other goals can be
 achieveduntil developersrenderthe algorithminto a prac
tical implementation, which will inevitably deviate from
 and expand upon the published form. Unless developers
 have a deep understanding of the algorithm and can cre
ate intuitions about it, it will be difficult for them to retain
 its desirable properties in their implementation.
 In this paper we addressed the issue of distributed con
sensus, where a widely accepted but impenetrable algo
rithm, Paxos, has challenged students and developers for
 many years. We developed a new algorithm, Raft, which
 we have shown to be more understandable than Paxos.
 We also believe that Raft provides a better foundation
 for system building. Using understandability as the pri
mary design goal changedthe way we approachedthe de
sign of Raft; as the design progressed we found ourselves
 reusing a few techniquesrepeatedly,such as decomposing
 the problem and simplifying the state space. These tech
niques not only improved the understandability of Raft
 but also made it easier to convince ourselves of its cor
rectness.
